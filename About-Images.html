	<img class="image" src="http://CordellBlaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/eagle-prairie-1.jpg"  title="Eagle Flying over the Prairie" alt="Alt text of an eagle flying over the prairie"/><p>A few things about images, you can style them using css, usually helpful things are to do width as a % of the page, but remember to set the min/max width!  Inspect element on the image to see an example.</p>
	<p>Note I also floated the image left, and added margin so the text could sit along-side the image with a little space between them.</p>
